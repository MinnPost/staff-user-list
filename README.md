# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate

I'd like to use this repository to make it easier to start off WordPress plugins with stuff I use all the time, especially if it's annoying to recreate or easy to forget.

Ideally it would be nice to make it configurable, so I could tell it what kind of things the plugin needs (does it need a front end, does it need template files, etc.) and have it prepared to do that stuff. Because it would also be nice to avoid having a bunch of stuff in there that I have to delete before I can use it.
